Silverstripe Eventful
======
**Silverstripe Eventful** is a simple event dispatcher for Silverstripe, that can be configured via YAML config. It is used to manage domain/application events on a more global scale than the extension system provided by Silverstripe.

It is pretty much a wrapper around the "league/event" package by thephpleague, so all credit goes to them.

### Features
- Namespaced Events
- YML config events
- Events are lazy loaded
